# gcry

A garbage collector written in Crystal, intended as an alternative to [bdwgc](https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc) (Boehm GC).

Ships as a **shard**: reopen Crystal’s `GC` module under `-Dgc_none` — no Crystal compiler or stdlib patch required.

> **Status:** Phase 7 complete — productized v0.1 (docs, policies, tuning, CI).

## Why

Crystal ships with Boehm today (`boehm` backend) and also supports `gc_none`. **gcry** replaces the `gc_none` stubs at require-time with a conservative mark–sweep collector implemented in Crystal — no Crystal compiler/stdlib patch required.

## Goals

- Match Crystal’s `GC` API (`malloc`, `malloc_atomic`, `collect`, fiber roots, finalizers, stats, …)
- Conservative stop-the-world mark–sweep on Linux x86_64 under Crystal 1.21+ `Fiber::ExecutionContext` (parallelism 1)
- Nursery + incremental mark slices (no write barriers / no parallel contexts yet)
- Allocation-free collector core (no managed-heap allocations during collect)
- Activate via `require "gcry"` + `-Dgc_none`

Details, non-goals, and phased roadmap live in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Supported platforms (v0.1)

| | |
|--|--|
| OS / arch | Linux x86_64 (primary); aarch64 cross-build experimental in CI |
| Crystal | `>= 1.21.0` |
| Runtime | Default `Fiber::ExecutionContext` (parallelism 1) — **not** parallel contexts / deprecated `-Dpreview_mt` |
| Fork / signals | See [docs/POLICY.md](docs/POLICY.md) |

## Requirements

- Crystal `>= 1.21.0`

## Installation

Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  gcry:
    github: sdogruyol/gcry
```

```sh
shards install
```

## Usage

Require gcry early when building with the null GC, then compile with `-Dgc_none`:

```crystal
{% if flag?(:gc_none) %}
  require "gcry"
{% end %}

puts "hello"
```

```sh
crystal build -Dgc_none app.cr -o app
./app
```

Without `-Dgc_none`, Crystal links Boehm; do not install gcry as the process GC in that mode.

There is no separate application-level allocator API for normal programs: allocations go through Crystal’s runtime (`GC.malloc` / language allocations). The shard overrides `GC` underneath.

### Tuning

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `GCRY_THRESHOLD` | Bytes since last major before auto-collect (process default **64 MiB**) |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_AUTO=1` | Disable major auto-collect |
| `GCRY_NURSERY` | Opt-in nursery; young bytes before minor (default off in process GC) |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_NURSERY=1` | Keep nursery disabled (process default) |

More detail: [docs/HARDENING.md](docs/HARDENING.md), [docs/POLICY.md](docs/POLICY.md).

## Performance (v0.1)

gcry is much closer to Boehm on throughput after process-GC tuning, but pauses are still longer when a major runs.

Rough numbers on Linux x86_64, Crystal 1.21, release builds, same Kemal “Hello World” app (`bench/kemal`), `wrk -c 100 -d 30`:

| GC | Approx. req/s | Notes |
|----|---------------|--------|
| Boehm (default) | ~110k | Baseline |
| gcry (`-Dgc_none`) | ~75–80k | Stable; occasional multi‑ms–1s major pauses |
| gcry + `GCRY_DISABLE_AUTO=1` | ~80k+ | Allocator path when collection is off |

What moved the needle (process GC defaults):

- Nursery **off** by default (opt-in via `GCRY_NURSERY`) — minors without write barriers were scanning all old objects
- Major threshold **64 MiB** (`PROCESS_GC_THRESHOLD`; override with `GCRY_THRESHOLD`)
- Cached `/proc/self/maps` static-root ranges; skip bulky `libcrypto` / `libssl` / `libpcre` segments
- O(log n) chunk index for mark pointer lookup

Library-heap microbench: `make bench` → `./bin/churn`. Process-GC load test: `make bench-kemal-wrk`.

Still not a drop-in Boehm replacement for the tightest latency SLOs — majors remain stop-the-world — but HTTP dogfooding throughput is in the same ballpark.

## Development

```sh
make spec          # unit specs under Boehm
make samples       # build -Dgc_none samples into bin/
make bench         # library-heap churn bench
make bench-kemal-wrk  # Kemal + wrk (-c 100 -d 30) under gcry
make format-check
```

Or directly:

```sh
crystal spec
crystal build -Dgc_none samples/stress.cr -o bin/stress && ./bin/stress 300
crystal build bench/churn.cr -o bin/churn && ./bin/churn 2000
cd bench/kemal && shards install
crystal build -Dgc_none --release src/server.cr -o ../../bin/kemal-gcry
PORT=3001 ../../bin/kemal-gcry   # then: wrk -c 100 -d 30 http://127.0.0.1:3001/
```

Heap unit tests run under the default (Boehm) GC while `Gcry::*` is exercised as a standalone allocator. Process-GC samples need `-Dgc_none`.
